## 🌟 Development Process

### Tech Stack 

I embarked on a solo journey, crafting this project in just 3 days. Here's a sneak peek into the coding adventure and the tech choices made:

- **Frontend**: [Vue.js]
- **State Management**: [Vuex]
- **Styling**: [Tailwind]
- **Icons**: [Heroicons]

## 🚀 Navigating Challenges

### The Pagination
One of the intriguing challenges faced during development was unraveling the intricacies of pagination. Finding the sweet spot between displaying the right number of pages and ensuring a seamless user experience proved to be a delightful yet mind-bending task.

### Hydration mismatch:
The hydration mismatch warning, a solo coder's cryptic puzzle. A solo detective mission ensued. Server vs. client structures were reconciled, and the warning messages bowed out one by one.


## 💡 My Approach to Challenges

### Stack Overflow Solitude:
Solo, but not alone – enter Stack Overflow. A silent partner in coding crime, offering wisdom and solutions. Strategic searches and a bit of trial and error – challenges met head-on.


## 🚀 About the Company

This project serves as a testament to my coding skills, a precursor to hopefully joining the fantastic team at **S. P. DIGITAL**. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute and learn alongside such a dynamic group.

Feel free to explore the code, open issues, or drop me a message. Exciting times ahead!
